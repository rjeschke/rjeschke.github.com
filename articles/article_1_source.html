[$PROFILE$]: extended
Command line Windows compiling
------------------------------

As I am developing on different platforms (Linux &amp; Windows)
I reached a point where I just didn't want to use a different
IDE on each platform. And as I got really used to Eclipse
I decided to use it as my main IDE for both Java and C/C++.

My current setup consists of Windows 7 32Bit, the 
[Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7][SDK] and [Eclipse 
Galileo SR2][Eclipse]. Yes, I'm still using Galileo, Helios
somehow seems uncomfortable.

#### First step: Setting up environment variables ####

I assume you know how to set up environment variables on Windows.

*   ##### INCLUDE
    You will have to include the following directories:
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Include\
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include\
    And if you want to do JNI:
        C:\Program Files\Java\&lt;your-JDK&gt;\include\
        C:\Program Files\Java\&lt;your-SDK&gt;\include\win32\
*   ##### LIB
    You will have to include the following directories:
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Lib\
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\
    And again for JNI:
        C:\Program Files\Java\&lt;your-SDK&gt;\lib\
*   ##### PATH
    These are the paths the compiler needs:
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0\Bin\
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\
    And this one is again for JNI:
        C:\Program Files\Java\&lt;your-SDK&gt;\bin\

If you're using a different Platform SDK, just use the highest version
number inside the SDK folder, and the highest version of Visual Studio
that contains the above mentioned paths.

#### Next step: Setting up Eclipse C/C++ ####

*   Start a new C or C++ project, make it an empty makefile project.
*   As I need to compile my stuff on different OSes, I always create a 
    folder inside the project that's called 'win32' (for 32 Bit).
    I assume you do the same.
*   In Project Properties &gt; C/C++ Build uncheck 'Use default build command'
    and type into 'Build command:'
        nmake -f makefile.mak
    As Build Directory choose:
        ${workspace_loc:/&lt;your-project&gt;/win32}
*   In C/C++ Build &gt; Settings check 'PE Windows Parser'
*   In C/C++ General &gt; Paths and Symbols &gt; Includes do: Add &gt; Variable &gt; INCLUDE, 
    just add it to all configurations and languages
*   Sadly there's no working toolchain for Windows, so you will have to
    tell Eclipse which defines you set up in your makefile. This can be
    done in C/C++ General &gt; Paths and Symbols
*   My standard defines that I set up are:
        __int8      char
        __int16     short
        __int32     int
        __int64     long
        WIN32       1
    This minimizes the amount of validation errors Eclipse may produce.

Now, all you have to do is code some stuff and write some cool makefile.

And you should remap 'Ctrl+B' in Eclipse to point to 'Compile current Project'
and not all projects.
